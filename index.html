          <p class="question">WHO IS GENERAL SUN Tzu?</p>
          <h1>THE GREATEST MILITARY STRATEGIST</h1>
          <p>
            The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born.
            The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later Records of the
            Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi. Both
            sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and
            Autumn period and that he was active as a general and strategist,
            serving King Helü of Wu in the late sixth century BC, beginning
            around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The
            Art of War. The Art of War was one of the most widely read military
            treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a time of
            constant war among seven ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu,
            Han, Wei, and Yan–who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile
            territory in <span>Eastern China.</span>
